About the Project
Book Roulette is a fun and intuitive application designed to help readers break out of reading slumps. Instead of overthinking what to read next, users spin the roulette and get a randomly selected book recommendation based on available data or preferences. The idea is to make reading spontaneous, exciting, and stress‑free.

This project blends logic, randomness, and a love for books—turning decision fatigue into a delightful experience.

Why Book Roulette?

Choosing a book can sometimes be harder than reading one. Book Roulette solves this by:

Removing choice overload

Encouraging exploration of new genres/authors

Making reading fun and game‑like
